DFLib is a library of C++ classes for computing the locations of
transmitters from bearings-only measurements.  See
docs/html/index.html for detailed documentation fo the classes.

Quick start:


Old-style autoconf build:

  Bootstrapping:
  You must have GNU Autoconf (version 2.60) or later, GNU Automake
  (version 1.11 or later) and GNU Libtool (version 2.x) to get started
  with the code if you have cloned it directly from github.  The bootstrap.sh
  script must be run once upon checking out the code --- this will create the
  configure script necessary to do the build.  This only needs to be done
  on initial checkout and when either of the files configure.ac or Makefile.am
  gets modified.  Released versions of the code (when this happens someday)
  will have configure already generated in the tarball.

   mkdir build
   cd build
   ../configure
   make

Add configure command line arguments as needed to find PROJ.4 library.
See INSTALL for details.


New style CMake build (cross-platform): See INSTALL_CMake


Two demo programs are built by this process, SimpleDF and
testlsDF_proj.  See their respective entries in docs/html/index.html
for some documentation about them.

DFLib is primarily intended as a set of building blocks for DF fix
programs, not as a finished product itself.
