DFLib is a library of C++ classes for computing the locations of
transmitters from bearings-only measurements.  See
docs/html/index.html for detailed documentation fo the classes.

Quick start:


Old-style autoconf build:

   mkdir build
   cd build
   ../configure
   make

Add configure command line arguments as needed to find PROJ.4 library.
See INSTALL for details.


New style CMake build (cross-platform): See INSTALL_CMake


Two demo programs are built by this process, SimpleDF and
testlsDF_proj.  See their respective entries in docs/html/index.html
for some documentation about them.

DFLib is primarily intended as a set of building blocks for DF fix
programs, not as a finished product itself.
