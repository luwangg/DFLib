Tentative documenation for building with CMake.

Linux/BSD:

   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make

Losedows:
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -G"NMake Makefiles" -DPROJ_LIBRARY=c:\proj-4.6.1\src\proj.lib -DPROJ_INCLUDE_DIR=c:\proj-4.6.1\src\
   nmake

   This assumes that proj.4 libraries were built in-place in c:\proj-4.6.1.  No
   attempt is made to search for them elsewhere.  FIXME.
