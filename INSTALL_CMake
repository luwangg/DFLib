Tentative documenation for building with CMake.

Linux/BSD:

   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make

This assumes you have proj.4 installed properly where cmake can just find it.

Losedows:

It is tricky here, because Losedows debug and release builds of
libraries cannot be used interchangeably in debug or release
executables.  If you intend to build release binaries for distribution
(because debug binaries are not freely distributable according to the
Visual C++ license), then you need to make both versions of libraries
and link with the right one at build time.

Here's how to make the debug library:

   mkdir build_debug
   cd build_debug
   cmake .. -G"NMake Makefiles" -DPROJ_LIBRARY=c:\proj-4.6.1\debug\lib\proj.lib -DPROJ_INCLUDE_DIR=c:\proj-4.6.1\src\
   nmake

   This assumes that proj.4 libraries were built in c:\proj-4.6.1 and
   that the proj-4 nmake.opt file was edited to use debugging options
   *and* that INSTDIR was set to the debug subdirectory, and that
   nmake /f makefile.vc install-all was run after build.  No attempt
   is made to search for them elsewhere.  FIXME.

And here's how to do the release library:
   mkdir build_release
   cd build_release
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release -G"NMake Makefiles" -DPROJ_LIBRARY=c:\proj-4.6.1\release\lib\proj.lib -DPROJ_INCLUDE_DIR=c:\proj-4.6.1\src\
   nmake

   This assumes that proj.4 libraries were built in c:\proj-4.6.1 and
   that the proj-4 nmake.opt file was edited to use release options
   *and* that INSTDIR was set to the release subdirectory, *and* that
   nmake /f makefile.vc install-all was run after build.  No attempt
   is made to search for them elsewhere.  FIXME.

If you don't do this carefully and attempt to link the debug version
of DFLib with the release version of proj (or vice-versa) the link
phase of DFLib will report "MSVCRT conflicts with other libraries" or
some such, and the resulting .exe files for SimpleDF or testlsDF_proj
will crash.  Same goes for othe codes built against DFLib, such as
qDF.  This is a royal pain in the neck on windows, but once one gets
it figured out and all the libraries built in both versions, it works
out OK.
