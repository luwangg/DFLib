Fix Doxygen "mainpage.dox" to link to basic build instructions!  Now that
we have a GitHub site, it's going to be the first order of business to make
it so that the build is documented.

- Improve interface of the Report and ReportCollection classes.  It is 
  woefully incomplete, as evidenced by how much work the qDF subclassed 
  versions have to fix up on their own.  Things like looking up by name,  
  providing access to report pointers, etc.  The original thought was that
  the collection would not be the only place a pointer to a report was kept,
  and that the application could keep a usable pointer for editing etc.  This 
  has proven to be a short-sighted design choice and one that complicates use
  of the classes.

- Fix up SimpleDF to do more error checking.  Use error checks in testlsDF_proj
  as example.

- Add more doxygen markup

- Fix up code to remove compiler warnings
